# lab-notebook
This is a web application built with Python using the Django framework. The app simulates a lab notebook and allows you to enter data into form fields, generate a graph, and save the results. Specifically, this app is used to determine the concentration of an unknown sample using a trendline generated from known standards. This is typically done using UV/Vis spectroscopy.

From Wikipedia: "The Beer-Lambert law states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution and the path length.[3] Thus, for a fixed path length, UV/Vis spectroscopy can be used to determine the concentration of the absorber in a solution. It is necessary to know how quickly the absorbance changes with concentration. This can be taken from references (tables of molar extinction coefficients), or more accurately, determined from a calibration curve."
